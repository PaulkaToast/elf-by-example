## About
This repository is to serve as a way to learn and experiment with how compilers,
linkers, and the C runtime work cooperatively to make an application start, run, and
shutdown. Most of the concepts and the mechanics involved are explained using examples
from the `examples` directory of this git repository.

## Static Linking
Currently, we are limiting ourselves to static linking (both PIE and non-PIE variations).
At some point in future, we might add information and examples about dynamic linking.
In the meantime, interested readers can contribute dynamic linking related examples
and topics.

## Examples
Each example comes with its own `README.md` which explains what that example is trying
to illustrate. General information about the examples is available in `examples/README.md`.
It has information like suggested order of walking the examples, how to prepare a new
example, how to build an example etc.
