## Why are relocations present in the ELF of a statically linked executable?

ELF file of a statically linked non-PIE will have relocations to support
[_ifuncs_](https://github.com/sivachandra/elf-by-example/tree/master/examples/ifunc).
ELF file of a statically linked PIE will additional have one specific kind
of dynamic relocations. These relocations are required to adjust for the
load address (a [PIE](pie.md) is loaded at a different address every time it
runs). See this [example](https://github.com/sivachandra/elf-by-example/tree/master/examples/global_var_ptr)
for a more elaborate illustration.

## What are linker generated relocations?

A coworker once asked, "Aren't relocations generated by the compiler/assembler?
What are linker generated relocations?" It is true that the compiler and/or
the assembler generate the relocations. The static linker makes use of these
relocations to perform the linking. Some values, like global variable
addresses in a PIE, can only be known after the program starts. For such values,
the linker typically replaces the compiler generated relocations with its own
relocations which are most suitable for the linking mode used (for example, 
`-pie` or `-static-pie`). The relocations generated by the linker are applied
by the [CRT](crt.md) or the dynamic linker. This [example](https://github.com/sivachandra/elf-by-example/tree/master/examples/global_var_ptr)
illustrates one such relocation relevant for static-pie linking.
